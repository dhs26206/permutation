# permutation
This can calculate no. of arrangements of a word or a number.
for example you had entered DDKS ,, so it will show you all the arrangements which can be made from 'DDKS' by calcualtion it will show 12 arrangements like [KDSD,DDSK,DKDS,DDKS,KDDS,DSKD,SDDK,DSDK,KSDD,DKSD,SKDD,SDKD]
it can also sort this arrangements of this list !
The .exe File can do this whole work
But .py file can only calculate the number of arrangements !, 
{{''import permutation
  per(a)  where a is anything like(247001,DDKS,JKH567)}}
